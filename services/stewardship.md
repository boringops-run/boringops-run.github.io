  <h2>This service is in development</h2>
  <p>
    Ongoing Stewardship is a retainer engagement designed to maintain operational
    discipline after initial chaos has been addressed. It prevents the slow return
    of complexity that happens when attention moves elsewhere.
  </p>
</div>

## What This Will Be

Ongoing senior oversight to prevent entropy, drift, and "exciting" decisions from re-introducing chaos.

This is not incident response. It is adult supervision:

- **Drift detection** - Identifying when operational discipline begins to erode
- **Risky initiative review** - Pricing new complexity before it gets introduced
- **Architecture shape pressure** - Maintaining structural simplicity over time
- **Re-pricing decisions** - Catching costly choices before damage is done

This is where BoringOps becomes governance, not a project.

## How It Will Work

A retainer-based engagement with regular touchpoints:

- Periodic review of operational health indicators
- Advisory input on changes with operational impact
- Early warning when patterns suggest drift toward chaos
- Pressure on system shape and decision quality

No firefighting. No tooling. No project management.

## Prerequisites

This engagement requires:

- A completed Chaos Assessment
- A completed Chaos Tolerance Decision (or equivalent binding commitment)
- Demonstrated willingness to maintain constraints over time
