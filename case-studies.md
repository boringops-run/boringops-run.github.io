# Example Scenarios

These case studies are composite illustrations based on common patterns we encounter. They represent the types of engagements we undertake, not specific clients.

## Common Patterns

Every organization's chaos is unique, but we see common patterns:

**Incident Fatigue**
Teams drowning in alerts, spending more time firefighting than building. The solution is rarely more monitoring. It is better monitoring.

**Knowledge Silos**
Critical systems understood by one person. Bus factor of one. The solution is systematic documentation and deliberate knowledge transfer.

**Compliance Anxiety**
Security and compliance seen as obstacles to velocity. The solution is infrastructure that makes the right way the easy way.

**Scale Panic**
Growth triggers fear instead of excitement. The solution is foundations that scale predictably.
