# Let's Talk

Every engagement begins with a conversation. No sales pitch, no pressure. Just an honest discussion about your current challenges and whether we can help.

---

## Start the Conversation

The best way to reach us is email:

<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <a href="mailto:dan@boringops.run?subject=Consulting%20Inquiry&body=Hi%20Dan,%0D%0A%0D%0AI'm%20interested%20in%20learning%20more%20about%20BoringOps%20consulting.%0D%0A%0D%0AHere's%20some%20context%20about%20our%20situation:%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%80%A2%20Company%20/%20team%20size:%0D%0A%E2%80%A2%20Primary%20infrastructure%20/%20stack:%0D%0A%E2%80%A2%20Main%20pain%20points:%0D%0A%E2%80%A2%20What%20%22boring%22%20would%20look%20like%20for%20us:%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks,">

## What to Include

To make our first conversation productive, it helps to share:

- **Your role** and decision-making context
- **Team size** and structure (engineering, ops, platform)
- **Primary infrastructure** (cloud providers, key technologies)
- **Current pain points** (incidents, scaling, velocity, on-call burden)
- **What "boring" would look like** for your organization
- **Timeline and urgency** (exploring vs. active project)
