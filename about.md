# About BoringOps

BoringOps Consulting was founded on a simple observation: the most successful infrastructure organizations are the most boring ones.

---

## The Founder

**Dan Zrobok** is a veteran infrastructure leader with over two decades of experience building and scaling operations at companies ranging from scrappy startups to Fortune 500 enterprises.

Over that time, he noticed a pattern: the teams that shipped fastest, slept best, and retained talent longest were not the ones with the most cutting-edge stacks. They were the ones that had mastered the fundamentals. The boring ones.

This insight became the foundation for BoringOps: first as a philosophy, then as a practice, and now as a consulting firm dedicated to helping organizations escape the chaos trap.

### Background

- 20+ years in infrastructure, operations, and platform engineering
- Led operations at multiple high-growth startups through scale challenges
- Built and managed teams across three continents
- Survived (and learned from) more outages than he would like to admit
- Author of the [BoringOps Manifesto](https://boringops.sh)

## The Philosophy

BoringOps is not anti-innovation. It is anti-chaos.

The philosophy emerged from years of watching smart teams make predictable mistakes: chasing the new instead of mastering the known, building for excitement instead of reliability, rewarding heroics instead of prevention.

The [BoringOps Manifesto](https://boringops.sh) codifies the principles that separate sustainable operations from perpetual firefighting.

> **Shiny dulls. Boring endures.**

## Why Consulting?

After years of building boring operations inside organizations, the natural next step was helping others do the same.

BoringOps Consulting exists because:

1. **The pattern is recognizable.** Operational chaos looks similar everywhere.
2. **The solutions are transferable.** What works at one company works at others.
3. **Outside perspective accelerates change.** Internal teams are often too close to see the root causes.
4. **Knowledge transfer multiplies impact.** Teaching ten teams is better than fixing one system.

## Working With Us

We work with organizations that are:

- **Ready for change.** Transformation requires commitment, not just budget.
- **Willing to invest in fundamentals.** No magic shortcuts.
- **Open to uncomfortable truths.** Assessments reveal problems; that is the point.
- **Committed to knowledge transfer.** We build capability, not dependency.

We are not a good fit if you are looking for:

- A vendor to own your problems permanently
- The newest, shiniest tools
- Quick fixes without addressing root causes
- Someone to blame when things go wrong
